This is a game I&#39;ve been working on when Covid-19 started and was in isolation.
The game is a combination of two genres: **Rhythm** and **FPS** with a focus on the rhythm part.

## Code
Please don&#39;t look at the code unless you are **reaaaaallyyyyyy** interested. The idea was to make the game event driven but... the events were magic strings. I know, I know...

Another problem I had was coupling Unity functionallity with the game logic too tightly.

There weren&#39;t too many bugs but it wasn&#39;t really scaleable and my limited art skills didn&#39;t help either to keep the game inside a realistic scope.
